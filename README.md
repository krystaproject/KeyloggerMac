# KeyloggerMac
A sample tool to log key inputs on MacOS

## Purpose
This project is essentially a clone of an old, unmaintained keylogger on github that I think serves as a great example of how a basic keylogger works. I do plan on maintaining this as its own project now.

##### Update
- Found the original project https://github.com/laurinpaech/Keylogger if this ever gets updated this repo will be archived.

## Usage
Just set your log path in logger.c, cd to this folder then run "make". Then you can start this by running ./logger in that folder.
